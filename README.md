# Microcontroller

Some of the first executable programs I did, before I had done something in Flash, Html and JavaScript, would say my first 
programming language.

They are micro-controllers for a CNC Robot, however they have a bug in the calculations that I fixed after, however I don't 
have this version, Imagine coordinates X,Y,Z, you have to go for a point, then first you move in X, after in Y, After in Z , 
like a claw catching bears, my program go direct to the point X to a point Z straight ahead, however I don't have a correct 
environment to test it today, I don't have more the electronic circuits to test, I have to make that again.
